# Snake Game - Pygame üêç

An implementation of the classic Snake game using the `pygame` library. Traverse the grid, eat fruits, and grow your snake, but watch out! Don't run into the walls or yourself.

## Features

- **Smooth Controls**: Easy and intuitive keyboard arrow controls.
- **Dynamic Speed**: The snake speeds up as it consumes more fruits, offering increasing challenge as you play.
- **Custom Graphics**: Modern pixel art aesthetics and a colourful design.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your high score and challenge yourself to do better each time!

## How to Play

1. **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
2. **Objective**: Eat the red fruit that appears on the screen.
3. **Grow & Speed Up**: As you eat more fruits, your snake grows in length and moves faster.
4. **Avoid Collisions**: If the snake collides with the wall or itself, it's game over!

- Python 3.x
